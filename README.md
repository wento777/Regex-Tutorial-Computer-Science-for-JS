# Regex-Tutorial-Computer-Science-for-JS



 ## Description 

- This project was designed as a homework assignment for KU coding bootcamp in Module 17 
Computer Science for JavaScript Challenge: Regex Tutorial.

- Developers write code, but they also write about code. Take a moment to search the web for tutorials about any of the subjects you’ve learned so far in this course. You’re likely to find thousands of tutorials written by developers of all skill levels, but especially by junior developers—like you!

- Testing is key to making code maintainable, you’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.


- A major aspect of this challenge was the balance between figuring out which solution made sense and the solution that would be most efficient.

- Make sure to clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!

- You are required to submit the following for review:

    The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.

- Make sure to create a public gist and add the .md file extension to the file name so that your Markdown renders correctly.

 ## Installation

  - Make sure to clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!

  - Before you start, clone the starter codeLinks to an external site..

  - In order to install inquirer, i used npm i inquirer@8.2.4.

  - The application will be invoked by using the following command: 'npm start'


## Usage

  - Make sure to clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!

  - Instead of creating a repository, you’ll publish a GitHub gist. GitHub describes a gist as a simple way to share code snippets with others. It’s also an ideal way to demonstrate a technique, teach a principle, or show off a solution

  -  It functions just like a repository, and you’ll use Markdown to create it, just as you do with your READMEs. Gists can include code, images, links, and anything else you can include in a README.

  - After you’ve cloned the starter code, learn how to create a gistLinks to an external site.. You can also watch this video on how to use gists.
     
 - The starter code is a template with a title, introductory paragraph, summary, and table of contents. The table of contents should link to sections of the tutorial that describe the functionality of each component in the regex. Be sure to rename the template to a unique name that describes your tutorial.


  


## User Story

AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile.

## Summary

Your Challenge this week is to create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. You'll use the template provided in the starter code to create your tutorial.
